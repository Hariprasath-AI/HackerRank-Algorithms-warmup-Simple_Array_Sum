# HackerRank-Algorithms-warmup-Simple_Array_Sum

Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.
For example, if the array ar = [1,2,3] , 1 + 2 + 3 = 6


Input Format:
  The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the size of the array.
  The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array's elements.
  
 
Contraints:
  0 < n, ar[i] <= 1000
  
  
Output Format:
  Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.
  
  
Sample Input:
  6
  1 2 3 4 10 11
  
  
Sample Output:
  31
  

Explanation:

We print the sum of the array's elements: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 31
