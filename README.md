# Actual Problem Question

Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.
For example, if the array ar = [1,2,3] , 1 + 2 + 3 = 6


Input Format:
  The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the size of the array.
  The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array's elements.
  
 
Contraints:
  0 < n, ar[i] <= 1000
  
  
Output Format:
  Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.
  
  
Sample Input:
  6
  1 2 3 4 10 11
  
  
Sample Output:
  31
  

Explanation:

We print the sum of the array's elements: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 31


# Changes in actual Question

I changed a bit in the approach. While the first line is the no of inputs i.e., numbers which we have to add. By mistaken user gives a mismatching Size at firstline or gives a wrong no of inputs in second line, we have to intimate them as "Invalid Input" or "Size Mismatched".  HackerRank-Algorithms-warmup-Simple_Array_Sum.py file never shows the result until the user gives correct input i.e., the no of Inputs and length of array gets matched.
